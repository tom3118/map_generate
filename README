This package installs a script that provides methods to extract line segments 
from an image and also to
write such segments as walls in a simpedia-readable xml format

This script takes an image, performs edge detection followed by a Probabilistic
Hough Transform to find straight lines.  It then creates a simpedia <obstacles>
element that contains each of these lines as a wall.

The transform params were cribed without thought from 
http://scikits-image.org/docs/0.3/auto_examples/plot_hough_transform.html
(hence there is plenty of room for improvement)

Additional functionality: there are now options for applying line-thinning
to correct the thickness of walls.
