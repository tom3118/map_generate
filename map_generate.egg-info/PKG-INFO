Description: This package installs a script that provides methods to extract line segments 
        from an image and also to
        write such segments as walls in a simpedia-readable xml format
        
        This script takes an image, performs edge detection followed by a Probabilistic
        Hough Transform to find straight lines.  It then creates a simpedia <obstacles>
        element that contains each of these lines as a wall.
        
        The transform params were cribed without thought from 
        http://scikits-image.org/docs/0.3/auto_examples/plot_hough_transform.html
        (hence there is plenty of room for improvement)
        
        Additional functionality: there are now options for applying line-thinning
        to correct the thickness of walls.
